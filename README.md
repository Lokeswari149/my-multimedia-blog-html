# my-multimedia-blog-html
A simple HTML mini project: My Multimedia Blog sponsored by TAP Academyâ„¢. This project showcases my favorite songs and top 3 most-watched Indian film trailers on YouTube with embedded audio, video, images, and text. Built using HTML5 tags such as &lt;audio>, &lt;video>, &lt;img>, &lt;mark>, &lt;ins>, &lt;del>, &lt;abbr>, and more to highlight multimedia integration.
